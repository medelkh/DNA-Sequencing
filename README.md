# DNA-Sequencing
Under the assumption that DNA reads are 100% accurate, and uniformly distributed within the DNA sequence, the following algorithm reconstructs the initial DNA sequence from a big number of given reads by finding an Eulerian path in a DeBruijn Graph and taking into account the average "coverage" for every "edge" of the graph.
